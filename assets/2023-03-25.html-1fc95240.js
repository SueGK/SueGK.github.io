More specifically, if the input image is shifted or translated, the output of the network will also be shifted or translated accordingly. This property is useful for tasks such as object detection, where the location of the object within the image is important.</p><p>In CNNs, translation invariance is achieved through the use of pooling layers, which aggregate <strong>feature maps</strong> into a more compact representation while preserving the most important features. Meanwhile, translation equivariance is achieved through the use of convolutional layers, which apply a filter or kernel to the input image to <strong>extract local features</strong> that are then combined to form a larger, more complex feature map. By using a combination of convolutional and pooling layers, CNNs are able to achieve both translation invariance and equivariance, making them highly effective for image recognition tasks.</p><h2 id="max-pooling-breaks-shift-equivariance-—-try-antialiaing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#max-pooling-breaks-shift-equivariance-—-try-antialiaing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Max Pooling breaks shift equivariance? — Try antialiaing</h2><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Wyy2QtclkDCkUXbA.gif" alt="Making Convolutional Networks Shift-Invariant Again" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Making Convolutional Networks Shift-Invariant Again</figcaption></figure><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are approximately shift equivalent through their convolutional layers. However, the use of Max Pooling layers can break shift equivariance (also known as translation equivariance). To address this issue, one solution is to use anti-aliasing techniques in Computer Vision, such as blurring the image and then down-sampling it. This technique can help preserve important features in the image while reducing the effect of minor shifts or translations, which in turn can improve the shift equivariance of the CNN.</p>',15),m={href:"https://richzhang.github.io/antialiased-cnns/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},g=e("figure",null,[e("img",{src:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*unim0oPZtXDmRnWSXz4cyQ.png",alt:"",tabindex:"0",loading:"lazy"}),e("figcaption")],-1),f={href:"http://visual.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pubs/harmonicNets/index.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},p=e("figure",null,[e("img",{src:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*wIjQ3UY25Tk6BqHiI_1jZg.gif",alt:"",tabindex:"0",loading:"lazy"}),e("figcaption")],-1),v=e("h2",{id:"cnn-and-poorly-shift-invariant",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#cnn-and-poorly-shift-invariant","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),a(" CNN and Poorly shift invariant")],-1),b={href:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12177",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},w=e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly assumed to be invariant to small image transformations: either because of the convolutional architecture or because they were trained using data augmentation.
