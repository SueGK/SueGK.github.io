More specifically, if the input image is shifted or translated, the output of the network will also be shifted or translated accordingly. This property is useful for tasks such as object detection, where the location of the object within the image is important.</p><p>In CNNs, translation invariance is achieved through the use of pooling layers, which aggregate <strong>feature maps</strong> into a more compact representation while preserving the most important features. Meanwhile, translation equivariance is achieved through the use of convolutional layers, which apply a filter or kernel to the input image to <strong>extract local features</strong> that are then combined to form a larger, more complex feature map. By using a combination of convolutional and pooling layers, CNNs are able to achieve both translation invariance and equivariance, making them highly effective for image recognition tasks.</p><h2 id="max-pooling-breaks-shift-equivariance-—-try-antialiaing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#max-pooling-breaks-shift-equivariance-—-try-antialiaing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Max Pooling breaks shift equivariance? — Try antialiaing</h2>',11),p=e("img",{src:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Wyy2QtclkDCkUXbA.gif",alt:"Making Convolutional Networks Shift-Invariant Again",tabindex:"0",loading:"lazy"},null,-1),v={href:"https://richzhang.github.io/antialiased-cnns/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},b=e("p",null,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are approximately shift equivalent through their convolutional layers.
