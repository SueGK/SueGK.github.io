## [AMiner](https://www.aminer.cn/introduction) üåü

> [AMiner  ](http://aminer.org/)(aminer.org) aims to provide comprehensive search and mining services for researcher social networks. In this system, we focus on:
>
> (1) creating a semantic-based profile for each researcher by extracting information from the distributed Web;
>
> (2) integrating academic data (e.g., the bibliographic data and the researcher profiles) from multiple sources;
>
> (3) accurately searching the heterogeneous network;
>
> (4) analyzing and discovering interesting patterns from the built researcher social network. The main search and analysis functions in AMiner include:

* [Profile search](http://aminer.org/): input a researcher name (e.g.,[Jie Tang](http://aminer.org/profile/jie-tang/53f46a3edabfaee43ed05f08)), the system will return the semantic-based profile created for the researcher using information extraction techniques. In the profile page, the extracted and integrated information include: contact information, photo, citation statistics, academic achievement evaluation, (temporal) research interest, educational history, personal social graph, research funding (currently only US and CN), and publication records (including citation information, and the papers are automatically assigned to several different domains).
* [Expert finding](http://aminer.org/): input a query (e.g., data mining), the system will return experts on this topic. In addition, the system will suggest the top conference and the top ranked papers on this topic. There are two ranking algorithms, VSM and ACT. The former is similar to the conventional language model and the latter is based on our Author-Conference-Topic (ACT) model. Users can also provide feedbacks to the search results.
* [Conference analysis](https://cn.aminer.org/ranks/conf): input a conference name (e.g., KDD), the system returns who are the most active researchers on this conference, and the top-ranked papers.
* [Course search](https://www.aminer.cn/#): input a query (e.g., data mining), the system will tell you who are teaching courses relevant to the query.
* [Sub-graph search](https://www.aminer.cn/#): input a query (e.g., data mining), the system first tells you what topics are relevant to the query (e.g., five topics "Data mining", "XML Data", "Data Mining / Query Processing", "Web Data / Database design", "Web Mining" are relevant), and then display the most important sub-graph discovered on each relevant topic, augmented with a summary for the sub-graph.
* [Topic browser](https://www.aminer.cn/#): based on our Author-Conference-Topic (ACT) model, we automatically discover 200 hot topics from the publications. For each topic, we automatically assign a label to represent its meanings. Furthermore, the browser presents the most active researchers, the most relevant conferences/papers, and the evolution trend of the topic is discovered.
* [Academic ranks](https://cn.aminer.org/academicstatistics): we define 8  [measures  ](http://aminer.org/AcademicStatistics)to evaluate the researcher's achievement. The  [measures  ](http://aminer.org/AcademicStatistics)include "h -index", "Citation", "Uptrend, "Activity", "Longevity", "Diversity, "Sociability", "New Star". For each measure, we output a ranking list in different domains. For example, one can search who have the highest citation number in the "data mining" domain.
* [User management](https://www.aminer.cn/#): one can register as a user to: (1) modify the extracted profile information; (2) provide feedback on the search results; (3) follow researchers in AMiner; (4) create an AMiner page (which can be used to advertise confs/workshops, or recruit students).

Keep you updated with state-of-the-art technology is really important in the Machine learning and deep learning field.

There are some tips from Andre NG on how to read research papers. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI)

So, where can we find the popular papers?

## Paperswithcode ‚Äî [Browse State-of-the-Art](https://paperswithcode.com/sota)

The papers are well categorized so you can follow what Andre said, choose an area of interest like semantic segmentation, and read 15‚Äì20 papers to get a good understanding of this field. More importantly, you can find the paper‚Äôs code.
