## Read Technique

### FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE

1. **Choose a concept to learn** . Select a topic you’re interested in learning about and write it at the top of a blank page in a notebook.
2. **Teach it to yourself or someone else** . Write everything you know about a topic out as if you were explaining it to yourself. Alternately, actually teach it to someone else.
3. **Return to the source material if you get stuck** . Go back to whatever you’re learning from – a book, lecture notes, podcast – and fill the gaps in your knowledge.
4. **Simplify your explanations and create analogies** . Streamline your notes and explanation, further clarifying the topic until it seems obvious. Additionally, think of analogies that feel intuitive.

### 3-2-1 训练法

1. 随便找一本书，开始阅读，倒计时 3 分钟结束后合上书，找一张纸，画一张思维导图，把刚才你读到的关键点靠回忆记录下来。
2. 重新阅读刚才阅读的内容，区别是倒计时降低到 2 分钟，也就是你需要用 2 分钟完成刚才 3 分钟读完的内容，并补充刚才的导图里的内容。
3. 用 1 分钟再次重复上述过程。
